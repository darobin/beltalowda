              These two levels correspond on the one hand to the function of "hegemony"
              which the dominant group exercises throughout society and on the
              other hand to that of "direct domination" or command exercised
              through the State and "juridical" government. The functions in
              question are precisely organisational and connective. The intel
              lectuals are the dominant group's "deputies" exercising the sub
              altern functions of social hegemony and political government.
              These comprise :
            </p>
            <p>
              1. The "spontaneous" consent given by the great masses of the
              population to the general direction imposed on social life by the
              dominant fundamental group ; this consent is "historically" caused
              by the prestige (and consequent confidence) which the dominant
              group enjoys because of its position and function in the world of
              production.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The apparatus of state coercive power which "legally" enforces
              discipline on those groups who do not "consent" either actively or
              passively. This apparatus is, however, constituted for the whole of
              society in anticipation of moments of crisis of command and
              direction when spontaneous consent has failed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This way of posing the problem has as a result a considerable
              extension of the concept of intellectual, but it is the only way which
              enables one to reach a concrete approximation of reality. It also
              clashes with preconceptions of caste. The function of organising
              social hegemony and state domination certainly gives rise to a
              particular division of labour and therefore to a whole hierarchy of
              qualifications in some of which there is no apparent attribution of
              directive or organisational functions.

            <p>
              The hegemony of a directive centre over the intellectuals asserts
              itself by two principal routes : 1. a general conception of life, a
              philosophy (Gioberti), which offers to its adherents an intellectual
              "dignity" providing a principle of differentiation from the old
              ideologies which dominated by coercion, and an element of struggle
              against them ; 2 . a scholastic programme, an educative principle
              and original pedagogy which interests that fraction of the intel
              lectuals which is the most homogeneous and the most numerous
              (the teachers, from the primary teachers to the university pro
              fessors), and gives them an activity of their own in the technical
              field.

            <p>
              The Scholars' congresses which were repeatedly organised in the
              period of the early Risorgimento had a double effect: 1 . they
              regrouped the intellectuals of the highest grade, concentrating them
              and multiplying their infuence ; 2 . they obtained a more rapid
              concentration and a more decisive orientation of the intellectuals
              of the lower grades, who normally tend to follow the university
              professors and great scholars, through spirit of caste.
            </p>
            <p>
              The study of encyclopaedic and specialised reviews furnishes
              another aspect of the Moderates' hegemony. A party like that of
              the Moderates offered the mass of the intellectuals all the satis
              factions for their general needs which can be offered by a govern
              ment (by a governing party) through the State services.
